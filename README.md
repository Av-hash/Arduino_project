# Arduino_project
Aimed at implementing a **Password-Protected Security System** on TinkerCad which enables prompts the user to input a password using Keypad and checks whether the typed password matches to the original password set by the owner, in which case a Green LED lights up and a low pitch buzzer sound is produced and a welcome message is shown on the Serial Monitor, otherwise a Red LED light up and a high pitch alarm sound is produced to alert others and a Warning message is shown on the Serial Monitor.

## Hardware Requirements
* Arduino Uno
* Keypad
* Breadboard
* Piezo
* Two LEDs : Green and Red
* Two resistors
* Serial Monitor
